<h1> AngularJS and Jumping Back Into Programming - august 2015 </h1>
<p> Hello blog! It's been some time since I have posted and have written some code. As some may know I have
been busy most of my summer working and saving up money for <a href="https://boisecodeworks.com/" class="link-on-white" target="_blank">BoiseCodeWorks</a>
. Because of that I hadn't had much time to get on my computer and spend some time programming or learning JavaScript. After I finished saving
I jumped back into learning. When I did that I felt a little off because it had been so long since I wrote a single line of anything.
But as I have been reviewing everything it has all been coming back... mostly... so I'm back to learning JS and it's been fun!
I am trying to branch out a little by learning AngularJS also which is just a front-end JavaScript framework.
So just to keep the world up to date on my progress, that's where I'm at! Just preparing and getting ready to go to code school
that begins later this month. As I always say, I have much to learn.</p>

<h1>Node.js - may 2015</h1>
<p> Lately I have been learning Node in little workshops that are run inside the terminal. These workshops (programs) are made by a
a bunch of programmers at<a href="http://nodeschool.io/index.html" class="link-on-white" target="_blank"> NodeSchool</a>.
NodeSchool <a href="http://nodeschool.io/about.html" class="link-on-white" target="_blank">is an open source project ran by volunteers</a>
with a goal to make high quality programming curriculum. It's a fun way to learn. AND! it's all offline after you install the workshops through the
command line. Check out the links above if you are interested in learning Node.js! (update) FYI: I still need to learn Node

<h1>Ruby - april 2015</h1>
<p> Just after I began looking into JavaScript, I found Ruby. A simple and powerful programming language. Lately I have
been studying it on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" class="link-on-white" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. A GREAT website to learn about
new languages! Check it out if you're interested in coding or programming. (update) FYI: I don't know very much at all about Ruby

<h1>JavaScript - april 2015</h1>
<p> Recently I have been practicing some JavaScript so I can customize my site even more.
JavaScript gives actions to the site. Like when you click the success button on my main page
there is a bunch of confetti. The confetti is made with JavaScript.
JavaScript is <a href="http://blog.codeeval.com/codeevalblog/2015#.VQrwlVX3-iw=" class="link-on-white" target="_blank">one of the most popular languages</a> in the world and is a requirement
in order to become a solid web developer. I have much to learn.

<h1>PHP - march 2015</h1>
<p> Today I used PHP to make updating to my sites easier by dividing my sites into sections.
I did this by creating a header and a footer that I use on all of my pages to keep them somewhat uniform,
instead of writing new code for each and every page. PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
The image below shows what I've been working on. I don't know PHP and I don't plan to learn it anytime
soon, but I plan to at least use it for updating purposes. I still have much to learn.
(update) FYI: I don't know PHP</p>
