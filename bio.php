      <h1>This Is My (detailed) Story</h1>
      <p>
      For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated by technology. When I was younger my brothers introduced me to video games, and of course, I was very interested which years later brought me to the idea of making my own video game. My brothers showed
      me Scratch. A program for kids (typically used for teaching programming concepts) that is made as a kick start to programming. I was home schooled and had plenty of time to look into things. I quickly became interested, especially in making my own sprites
      and commanding them to do actions when I pressed a certain key. I would then put a health gauge on my character and would have them fight with one another. I played with that until I entered back into public school in 7th grade and got distracted.

      When I entered high school as a freshman we received tablets as a tool to help better our education within the school district. I used it and enjoyed it very much. It was an iPad 2. I then became interested in mobile technology and loved the hardware and
      design of the tech. "How could something so powerful be the size of a wallet?" I studied all of the cell phones that at that time were high-end and continued to do so and still do as a hobby. The Raspberry Pi model B caught my eye in early 2014. I
      thought maybe that would be my gateway into a greater field of computers. The Pi did give me a better idea of programming. I heard about Google Coder and used my Pi as a server so that I could make web apps. That's when I first learned the basics
      of a website such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I lost patience in all the coding and wanted something more to do with design. Maybe with fashion, maybe with furniture, maybe with... tech. I decided that maybe I really just was into the design and
      detail of a physical product. Not just a digital one. I then fell away from coding and computers.

      A year later I was finishing my first semester of my sophomore year and decided to be home schooled. When I went back to home school for my next semester
      I was  excited to create a new life. I decided once again to pick up on computers right where I left off before. I wanted to make a website. I wanted to show the world that I could do something worth being known for. I created my first
      website when I finally found x10hosting. A decent web host that was free. So, here I am with all my creations. I am excited to build upon my website and to learn more so that I can do more exciting things with code. It's almost like a super power,
      to be able to create pretty much anything and to make it available to the world. Create something that is me and share it to everyone.
