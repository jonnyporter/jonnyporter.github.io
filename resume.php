    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>For me, technology has always been a fascinating and amazing field. It never ceases to amaze.
    I am a tech enthusiast who loves to make things from code, especially when I know what I'm doing!
    I also enjoy learning new programming languages and figuring out problems.
    I am always looking to gain experience in JavaScript, and I understand HTML and CSS.</p>
