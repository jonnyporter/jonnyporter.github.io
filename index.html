          Alana, Breanne, and Malia have all been on the competitive swim team since they were kids where they developed their love for swimming. They are all CPR and Lifeguard Certified and have taught lessons and lifeguarded for 2 years. "We all feel strongly about the importance of learning to swim while you are young. Some of our best memories together have been on the water whether it's rafting, boating, surfing, or just swimming around without our parents having to worry about us. We would love to help your kids feel comfortable in the water so they can have their own awesome memories!"
